# 🦅 Goshawk Labs

**Goshawk Labs** is a grassroots science lab exploring the intersection of DIY science, offgrid resilience, tactical technology, and public science outreach. We build tools, run experiments, and share everything openly for the curious, the inventive, and the prepared.

## 🧪 What We Do

* **Science Experiments**  From water tension and atmospheric pressure to writing softwares, we document and share hands on science projects that anyone can replicate.
* **Post Apocalyptic Engineering**  Designing rugged, resilient tech for when the grid goes down. Think advanced sneakernets, solar rigs, portable servers, and personaly operated radio based networks.
* **Educational Outreach**  Interactive science shows, workshops, and demos in schools, hospitals, and underserved communities.
* **Open Hardware & Software**  Building and publishing tools that support local resilience and exploration.

## 🔬 Projects

Here’s a sampling of our ongoing and upcoming work:

* 🧼 **Wonders of Water**  A science show series for kids aged 714, packed with hands on demos around cohesion, adhesion, and pressure.
* 📦 **LocalDrop**  A localfirst file sharing and messaging system using USB, WiFi, or Bluetooth, no internet required.
* 🚙 **Iron Caravan**  A detailed survival logistics framework for offgrid vehicle based convoys, blending engineering, roleplay, and real world planning.
* 📡 **Snickernet Operator**  A bash based system for automatic file sync via USB, built for isolated or low bandwidth communities.
* 🎛 **Portable EW Vehicle**  An embedded tech platform for local communications, ADS-B tracking, and power distribution in mobile units.
